# Electric Car Charger Data Aggregation for Swiss Cantons üöó‚ö°

## Overview

Welcome to the Electric Car Charger Data Aggregation project for Swiss Cantons! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with code for aggregating and calculating data related to electric car chargers in each canton of Switzerland. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a researcher, or a curious mind, this project aims to provide insights into the electric car charging infrastructure across Swiss regions.

## Project Structure

- **`/UsedData`**: This directory holds raw and processed data files. Raw data is sourced from various public datasets related to electric car chargers, and processed data is stored for easy analysis.

- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter Notebooks are organized in this directory. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific canton, showcasing the aggregation and calculations performed on electric car charger data.

- **`/Resuls`**: All the outputs generated in this project will be stored in this folder.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matissch/analytics_project.git
   cd electric-car-charger-switzerland
   ```

## Data Preparation
Then notebooks charger and join geodata are used to prepare our data for our calculations and to then save them on to our MySQL database.

## Calculation
The notebooks calulcations_linear_regression and calculations_random_tree are the most important, since they contain our calculations.
